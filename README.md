# A Humble Attempt at properly Digitizing Tattwa Vaada works

This is a humble attempt to digitize the original sanskrit texts and also to make an epub3 out of it. The epub3 should be having the original sanskrit text, followed by a recital of the text (for pronunciation), and Dr. Prabhanjanachar's paata affixed to it.

## Setting up your system to view the Sanskrit format, as intended
Note that github displays the Sanksrit texts in Serif font, which isn't an optimal replication. We need to use the [Noto Sans Devanagari font](https://www.google.com/get/noto/#sans-deva).

- Download the [Sanskrit font](https://www.google.com/get/noto/#sans-deva) & install it
- Download the needed plain texts. For example, if you need Vishnu Tattwa Vinirnaya, download the txt file
- Open the downloaded file in an editor like Notepad or MS Word
- Change the font to Noto Sans Devanagari (the font you installed)
