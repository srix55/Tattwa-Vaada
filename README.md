# A Humble Attempt at properly Digitizing Tattwa Vaada works

Currently, there are only scanned copies of Shri Anandatheerthara Sarvamoola texts. This is a humble attempt to digitize the original sanskrit texts and also to make an epub3 out of it. The epub3 should be having the original sanskrit text, followed by a recital of the text (for pronunciation), and Dr. Prabhanjanachar's paata affixed to it.

There are many challenges. The first one being a lack of a decent font to represent the Sanskrit letters as they are. For example, none of the current fonts properly represent the letter "Shree" of Sanskrit.
